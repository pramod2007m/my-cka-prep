# Question
# You are managing a WordPress application running in a Kubernetes cluster
# Your task is to adjust the Pod resource requests and limits to ensure stable operation

# Tasks
# 1. Scale down the wordpress deployment to 0 replicas
# 2. Edit the deployment and divide the node resource evenly across all 3 pods
# 3. Assign fair and equal CPU and memory to each Pod
# 4. Add sufficient overhead to avoid node instability
# Ensure both the init containers and the main containers use exactly the same resource requests and limits
# After making the changes scale the deployment back to 3 replicas
